<hr class = "HrColor" />
<p><font class="Descript">Utilizes digital Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology to divide a 12.5kHz channel into two alternating time slots, with each carrying an individual call when operating in Repeater mode. As a result, both the assigned frequency and the assigned time slot must be specified in order to completely describe a digital repeater channel. Radios or Groups that need to talk together must be assigned to the same frequency and time slot. This is a channel-wide feature.
</font></p>
<strong>Note</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Only DMR mode supports this feature.</li>
<li>Using the OpenGD77 firmware this value can be automatically overridden by a Timeslot value applied to a Contact, or by the operator manually overriding the value using the star (*) key on the keypad</li>
<li>This setting is only relevant for repeater operation. Simplex DMR does not transmit timeslot information.</li>
