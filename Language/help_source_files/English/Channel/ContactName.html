<p><font class="Descript">Defines the call that may be initiated on the channel by pressing the Push-to-Talk (PTT) button. However, if the channel is attached to a Group List with multiple Groups and there is an activity on one of the Groups, pressing PTT will initiate a talkback instead of a new call if it is within the hang time of the prior call. Selecting the None option prevents a call from being initiated on the channel. </font></p>
