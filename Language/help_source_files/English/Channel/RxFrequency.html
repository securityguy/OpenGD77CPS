<p><font class="Descript">Sets a frequency (in MHz) on which the signal is received for the current channel. This is a channel-wide feature.
</font></p>
<strong>Note</strong> 
<ul>
<li>The frequency range that can be set depends on the band of the radio.</li> 
<li>For digital mode, when the transmit and receive frequencies are different, the channel will be defined as a repeater channel and the intercom will communicate with the repeater. You must disable the receive function only.</li>
