<strong>Sample</strong>
<ul id="ulRange">
<li>Sample 1：
"DTMF rate" is set to 10 digits per second (duration is 50 milliseconds). "* And # tone" is set to 500 milliseconds. Thus, the actual length of "* and # sounds" is 550 milliseconds.
However, if the launch starts with * and # sounds, the intercom compares the duration of the pitch with the "first digit time" and uses the longer one of the two.
<li>Sample 2：
"DTMF rate" is set to 10 digits per second (duration is 50 milliseconds). The first digit time is set to 100 milliseconds. "* And # tone" is set to 500 milliseconds. Therefore, the actual number of the first digit * or # is 550 milliseconds.
