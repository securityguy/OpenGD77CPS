<p><font class="Descript">Select the reference frequency to be used when receiving on the current channel. The reference frequency can be changed to allow the walkie-talkie to operate on certain channel frequencies (such as without changing the reference frequency, which will be occupied by internally generated dummy signals). In some channel frequencies, internally generated dummy signals are displayed as silent carriers. Changing the reference frequency can shift these permanent signal carriers to unused frequencies so that the desired channel frequency can still be used.
