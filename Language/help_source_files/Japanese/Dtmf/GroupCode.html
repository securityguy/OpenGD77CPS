<p><font class="Descript">You can use the DTMF character "A", "B", "C", "D", "*" or "#" to set up a group called "universal character code". If the receiver receives a valid ID code and one or all of its digits are replaced by the "universal character" group call code, the interphone will be decoded. In multiple groups of calls and packet calls, the universal character is very useful. The use of group calling code group call in code or select effective squelch call. The radio that is called by the group cannot respond automatically.
